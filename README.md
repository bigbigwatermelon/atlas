### Coding agents that carry multi-repo work from a task to a PR

**Local-first · no server · automation-first**

> **Weft** is a local-first desktop delivery hub where coding agents (Claude Code,
> Codex, OpenCode) drive work across **several repositories at once** — from a
> stated **Task** all the way to **clean pull requests**. You state the intent;
> Weft plans it, decides which repos to touch, spawns the agents, coordinates
> them, verifies the result, and opens the PRs. **You supervise and handle
> exceptions — you are not a required checkpoint in the loop.**

It is explicitly *not* a terminal emulator, and not a "watch the agents go"
dashboard. It is the **workspace-and-automation fabric** the agents deliver inside.

## The idea in one picture

A single workspace is a logical list of repo references. One **Task** fans out
into parallel **directions**, each running in its own isolated git worktree, each
driven by an agent — and converges back into pull requests.

## Why it's different

Most agent tools chat, or drive **one** repo. Weft's irreplaceable moment is
**cross-repo scope decomposition**: turning *one* task into *"these repos, this
split, in this order — and who does what."*

| | Most agent tools | **Weft** |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit of work** | a chat / one repo | a **Task** spanning many repos |
| **Decomposition** | you split it by hand | the **lead** derives scope from a live repo map |
| **Isolation** | one working tree | a **git worktree per write-repo**, lazily materialized |
| **Human role** | drive every step | **supervise**; act only on exceptions |
| **Quality gate** | a human nod | **executable verification** (lint · type · test · contract) |
| **Boundary** | open-ended | **Task → PR** — merge/CI/release stay with your repo's harness |
| **The agent CLIs** | re-wrapped / proxied | **native CLIs, verbatim** — hooks, skills, permissions intact |

## The model

Weft's structure *is* the product. Four nested layers, with sessions carrying a
**role**:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base','themeVariables':{'primaryColor':'#4F46E5','primaryTextColor':'#fff','primaryBorderColor':'#4F46E5','lineColor':'#888780'}}}%%
flowchart TD
    WS["🏛️ <b>Workspace</b><br/><sub>a logical list of repo refs</sub>"]
    TH["🧵 <b>Thread</b><br/><sub>one task / requirement · has a lead agent</sub>"]
    DIR["➡️ <b>Direction</b><br/><sub>a slice of the work · write/read repos · a tool</sub>"]
    SES["🖥️ <b>Session</b><br/><sub>tool × worktree · role + native session id</sub>"]

    WS --> TH --> DIR --> SES

    CUR(["👤 <b>curator</b> — maintains the repo map"])
    LEAD(["🧭 <b>lead</b> — read-only overview, plans, drives workers"])
    WORK(["⚙️ <b>worker</b> — executes one direction"])

    WS -.role.- CUR
    TH -.role.- LEAD
    SES -.role.- WORK
```

- **Curator** profiles each repo (one-line role, interfaces, stack) and builds the
  cross-repo dependency graph — the fuel for scope decomposition.
- **Lead** is *home*: a read-only conversation + control tower. It plans, derives
  scope, spawns workers, and drives them to convergence over a per-thread bus.
  **It never writes code, and never ingests a worker's raw transcript** — workers
  report structured summaries + diff stats.
- **Worker** executes one direction inside its own worktree, with a structured
  **brief** (scope + interface contract + acceptance).

## The board — a live trust dashboard

Because no human gates the work, the board isn't a to-do list you drag — it's a
**live projection of agent + git + check state**. Cards move through the lifecycle
on their own; you act only on the ones that surface.

It's **two levels, zoom-linked**:

- **Workspace board** — one card per **thread**, the whole portfolio at a glance.
  Each card shows its kind, direction count, what's **live** (running, pulsing),
  what's **failing**, and a **needs-you** badge.
- **Thread board** — one card per **direction / task**, drilled into a single work
  line, with a **Board ↔ Lead** tab to switch between the cards and the lead
  conversation.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base','themeVariables':{'primaryColor':'#4F46E5','primaryTextColor':'#fff','primaryBorderColor':'#4F46E5','lineColor':'#888780','secondaryColor':'#F2683C'}}}%%
flowchart LR
    Q["📋 Queued"] --> R["⚙️ In progress"] --> RV["👀 Review"] --> D["📦 Done"]
    R -.open ask / failing check.-> N["⚠️ Needs you"]
    RV -.-> N
    N -.resolved.-> R
```

- **"Needs you" is the exception lane Weft owns.** Whatever a task's stored status,
  an **open permission ask** or a **failing check** overlays it into *Needs you* —
  aggregated across every thread and surfaced at the very top of every view. When
  nothing is waiting, it's quietly empty.
- **Cards carry their acceptance signals** (running sessions, failing checks) so
  green you trust and red you open — provenance you can expand, not a bare label.
- **The human acts, not babysits.** Your verbs are Approve / Answer / Open /
  Review — plus drag-to-restatus a task between columns when you want to override
  what the agents inferred.

## Principles (non-negotiable)

1. **Automation is the north star.** Default path is autonomous: task in, PRs out.
   Every surface is built for *supervising* the flow, not driving it step by step.
2. **The human handles exceptions, not the line.** Weft adds **no approval gate of
   its own**. The only blocking interruptions are the tools' own permission prompts
   (passed through verbatim, never overridden) plus a configurable irreversible-action
   boundary. "What's waiting on me" is the rare exception, surfaced at the top.
3. **Drive native CLIs, never re-draw them.** Spawn `claude` / `codex` / `opencode`
   as plain binaries under the user's own config — preserving hooks, skills, and
   permissions. The native TUI runs verbatim in a PTY; Weft *frames* it.
4. **Cross-repo wiring is ephemeral.** Sibling repos are mounted read-only via
   temporary launch args (`--add-dir`); never written into a canonical repo's config.
5. **Hide the mechanism, present the decisions.** Worktrees / PTY / MCP bus / sidecar
   recede into **Inspect**. The task, scope, branch/PR/diff, tool choice, and brief
   stay first-class — every abstraction ships with a real escape hatch.
6. **Bilingual from day one.** zh / en, two layers — UI strings *and* agent output
   language. Internal state enums stay English; code/identifiers always English.

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+, the
> [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs), and the platform deps for
> [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). To actually drive agents
> you'll want one or more of the [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code),
> [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), or
> [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) CLIs installed.

```bash
# install frontend deps
npm install

# run the desktop app in dev (Vite + Tauri)
npm run tauri dev

# build a release bundle
npm run tauri build
```

Frontend-only iteration without the Rust shell:

```bash
npm run dev        # Vite dev server
npm run build      # type-check + production build
```

Backend tests:

```bash
cd src-tauri && cargo test
```

## Status

Weft is in **active development**. The vertical slices defined in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — single-tool end-to-end (M1), worktree orchestration +
data model (M2), three drivers + surfaces (M3), session interaction layer (M4),
lead/worker + lazy scope (M5), and the two-level agent-first board + config
delivery + i18n (M6) — are implemented or in progress. Current focus is
simplifying scope to a label-free, lazy-materialization model.

The deep design is in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md); the product thesis in
[`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md); the visual system in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).
